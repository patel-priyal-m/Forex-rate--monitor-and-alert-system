# Database & Caching (Phase 2)
# -----------------------------

# PostgreSQL Adapter
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
# PostgreSQL database adapter for Python

# Python client for Elasticsearch
# Used by: consumer (indexing rates for Kibana dashboards)
# Benefits: Time-series data for real-time visualization

# SQLAlchemy ORM
SQLAlchemy==2.0.23
# SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping library
# Used by: consumer (database models, queries)
# Benefits: Database abstraction, migration support, query building


# API Framework (Phase 3)
# ------------------------

# FastAPI Framework

# Used by: api (REST endpoints for querying rates)
# Features: Auto docs, type hints, async support

# ASGI Server
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
# Lightning-fast ASGI server
# Used by: Running FastAPI application
# Alternative: hypercorn, daphne

# Pydantic
pydantic==2.5.0
# Data validation using Python type hints
# Used by: FastAPI request/response models
# Benefits: Automatic validation, JSON serialization


# Dashboard (Phase 4)
# --------------------

# Streamlit
